    "### 2.4 Assignments in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments allow values to be put into variables. They are written in Java with the use of the equality symbol (=). In Java this symbol is known as the assignment operator. Simple assignments take the following form:\n",
    "``` variableName = value;```\n",
    "For example, to put the value zero into the variable score, the following as-signment statement could be used:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "score = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is to be read as “**set the value of score to zero**” or alternatively as “**score becomes equal to zero**”. Effectively, this puts the number zero into the box in memory we called score. If you wish, you may combine the assignment statement with a variable declaration to put an initial value into a variable as follows:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int score = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is equivalent to the two statements below:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int score;\n",
    "score = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although in some circumstances Java will automatically put initial values into\n",
    "variables when they are declared, this is not always the case and it is better\n",
    "explicitly to initialize variables that require an initial value.\n",
    "Notice that the following declaration will not compile in Java:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int score = 2.5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Can you think why?\n",
    "The reason is that the right-hand side of the assignment (2.5) is a real number.\n",
    "This value could not be placed into a variable such as score, which is declared to\n",
    "hold only integers, without some information loss. In Java, such information loss is\n",
    "not permitted, and this statement would therefore cause a compiler error.\n",
    "You may be wondering if it is possible to place a whole number into a variable\n",
    "declared to hold real numbers. The answer is yes. The following is perfectly legal:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "double someNumber = 1000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although the value on the right-hand side (1000) appears to be an integer, it can\n",
    "be placed into a variable of type double because this would result in no infor-\n",
    "mation loss. Once this number is put into the variable of type double, it will be\n",
    "treated as the real number 1000.0.\n",
    "Clearly, you need to think carefully about the best data type to choose for a\n",
    "particular variable. For instance, if a variable is going to be used to hold whole\n",
    "numbers or real numbers, use the double type as it can cope with both. If the\n",
    "variable is only ever going to be used to hold whole numbers, however, then\n",
    "although the double type might be adequate, use the int type as it is specifically\n",
    "designed to hold whole numbers.\n",
    "When assigning a value to a character variable, you must enclose the value in\n",
    "single quotes. For example, to set the initial difficulty level to A, the following\n",
    "assignment statement could be used:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "char level = 'A';\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember: you need to declare a variable only once. You can then assign values\n",
    "to it as many times as you like. For example, later on in the program the difficulty\n",
    "level might be changed to a different value as follows:2.5 Creating Constants\n",
    "``` javascript\n",

    "• the number of hours in a day (24);\n",
    "• the mathematical value of p (approximately 3.1416).\n",

    "The Hello world program that we developed in Chap. 1 is of course very simple\n",
    "indeed. One way in which this program is very limited is that it has no data to work\n",
    "on. All interesting programs will have to store data in order to give interesting\n",
    "results; what use would a calculator be without the numbers the user types into add\n",
    "and multiply? For this reason, one of the first questions you should ask when\n",
    "learning any programming language is “what types of data does this language allow\n",
    "me to store in my programs?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Simple Data Types in Java\n",
    "We begin this topic by taking a look at the basic types available in the Java\n",
    "language. The types of value used within a program are referred to as **data types**. If you wish to record the price of a cinema ticket in a program, for example, this value would probably need to be kept in the form of a **real number** (a number with a decimal point in it). However, if you wished to record how many tickets have been sold you would need to keep this in the form of an **integer** (whole number). It is necessary to know whether suitable types exist in the programming language to keep these items of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/table21.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java there are a few simple data types that programmers can use. These simple types are often referred to as **the primitive types** of Java; they are also referred to as **the scalar types**, as they relate to a single piece of information (a single real number, a single character etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2.1 lists the names of these types in the Java language, the kinds of value they represent, and the exact range of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, some kinds of data, namely integers and real numbers, can be kept as more than one Java type. For example, you can use the byte type, the short type or the int type to hold integers in Java. However, while each numeric Java type allows for both positive and negative numbers, the maximum size of numbers that can be stored varies from type to type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the type **byte** can represent integers ranging only from −128 to\n",
    "127, whereas the type **short** can represent integers ranging from −32,768 to\n",
    "32,767. Unlike some programming languages, these ranges are fixed no matter\n",
    "which Java compiler or operating system you are using.\n",
    "The character type, **char**, is used to represent characters from a standard set of\n",
    "characters known as the **Unicode** character set. This contains nearly all the char-\n",
    "acters from most known languages. For the sake of simplicity, you can think of this\n",
    "type as representing any character that can be input from your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **boolean** type is used to keep only one of two possible values:\n",
    "**true** or **false**. This type can be useful when creating tests in programs. For\n",
    "example, the answer to the question “have I passed my exam?” will either be either\n",
    "yes or no. In Java a **boolean** type could be used to keep the answer to this\n",
    "question, with the value **true** being used to represent **yes** and the value **false** to\n",
    "represent **no**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Declaring Variables in Java\n",
    "The data types listed in Table 2.1 are used in programs to create named locations in\n",
    "the computer’s memory that will contain values while a program is running. This\n",
    "process is known as **declaring**. These named locations are called **variables** because\n",
    "their values are allowed to vary over the life of the program.\n",
    "For example, a program written to develop a computer game might need a piece\n",
    "of data to record the player’s score as secret keys are found in a haunted house. The\n",
    "value held in this piece of data will vary as more keys are found. This piece of data\n",
    "would be referred to as a variable. To create a variable in your program you must:\n",
    "• give that variable a name (of your choice);\n",
    "• decide which data type in the language best reflects the kind of values you wish\n",
    "to store in the variable.\n",
    "What name might you choose to record the score of the player in our computer\n",
    "game?\n",
    "The rules for naming variables are the same as those we met when discussing the\n",
    "rules for naming classes in the previous chapter. However, the convention in Java\n",
    "programs is to begin the name of a variable with **a lower case** letter (whereas the\n",
    "convention is to start class names with an upper case letter). We could just pick a\n",
    "name like x, but it is best to pick a name that describes the purpose of the item of\n",
    "data; an ideal name would be **score**.\n",
    "Which data type in Table 2.1 should you use if you wish to record a player’s\n",
    "score? Well, since the score would always be a whole number, an integer type\n",
    "would be appropriate. There are four Java data types that can be used to hold\n",
    "integers (**byte, short, int** and **long**). As we said before, the only difference\n",
    "among these types is the range of values that they can keep. Unless there is specific\n",
    "reason to do otherwise, however, the **int** type is normally chosen to store integer\n",
    "values in Java programs. Similarly, when it comes to storing real numbers we will\n",
    "choose the **double** type rather than the **float** type.\n",
    "Once the name and the type have been decided upon, the variable is declared as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "``` \n",
    "dataType variableName;\n",
    "``` \n",
    "where dataType is the chosen primitive type and variableName is the chosen\n",
    "name of the variable. So, in the case of a player’s score, the variable would be\n",
    "declared as follows:\n",
    "```javascript \n",
    "int score;\n",
    "``` \n",
    "![](images/figure21.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.1 illustrates the effect of this instruction on the computer’s memory. As you can see, a small part of the computer’s memory is set aside to store this item. You can think of this reserved space in memory as being a small box, big enough to hold an integer. The name of the box will be score. In this way, many variables can be declared in your programs. Let’s assume that the player of a game can choose a difficulty level (A, B, or C); another variable could be declared in a similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "What name might you give this variable? An obvious choice would be **difficulty level** but remember names cannot have spaces in them. You could use an underscore to remove the space (**difficulty_level**) or start the second word with a capital letter to distinguish the two words (**difficultyLevel**). Both are well-established naming conventions in Java. Alternatively you could just shorten the name to, say, level; that is what we will do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what data type in Table 2.1 best represents the difficulty level? Since the levels are given as characters (**A, B** and **C**) the **char** type would be the obvious choice. At this point we have two variables declared: one to record the score and one to record the difficulty level.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int score;\n",
    "char level;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, several variables can be declared on a single line if they are all of the same type. For example, let’s assume that there are ghosts in the house that hit out at the player; the number of times a player gets hit by a ghost can also be recorded. We can call this variable hits. Since the type of this variable is also an integer, it can be declared along with score in a single line as follows:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int score, hits; // two variables declared at once\n",
    "char level ; // this has to be declared separately\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](images/figure22.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.2 illustrates the effect of these three declarations on the computer’s memory. Notice that the character box, level, is half the size of the integer boxes score and hits. That is because, in Java, the **char** type requires half the space of the **int** type. You should also be aware that the **double** type in Java requires twice the space of the **int** type.\n",
    "You’re probably wondering: if declaring a variable is like creating a box in memory, how do I put values into this box? The answer is with assignments."

    "### 2.6 Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than just assign simple values (such as 24 and 2.5) to variables, it is often useful to carry out some kind of arithmetic in assignment statements. Java has the four familiar arithmetic operators, plus a remainder operator, for this purpose. These operators are listed in Table 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/table22.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these operators in assignment statements, much like you might use a calculator. For example, consider the following instructions:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int x;\n",
    "x = 10 + 25;\n",
    "```\n",
    "After these instructions the variable x would contain the value 35: the result of adding 10 to 25. Terms on the right-hand side of assignment operators (like 10 + 25) that have to be worked out before they are assigned are referred to as\n",
    "expressions. These expressions can involve more than one operator. Let’s consider a calculation to work out the price of a product after a sales tax has been added. If the initial price of the product is 500 and the rate of sales tax is 17.5%, the following calculation could be used to calculate the total cost of the product:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "double cost;\n",
    "cost = 500 * (1 + 17.5/100);\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this calculation the final cost of the product would be 587.5. By the way, in case you are wondering, the order in which expressions such as these are evaluated is the same as in arithmetic: terms in brackets are calculated first, followed by division and multiplication, then addition and subtraction. This means that the term in the bracket (1 + 17.5/100) evaluates to 1.175, not 0.185, as the division is calculated before the addition. The final operator (%) in Table 2.2\n",
    "returns the remainder after integer division (this is often referred to as the modulus). Table 2.3 illustrates some examples of the use of this operator together with the values returned. As an illustration of the use of both the division operator and the modulus operator, consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/table22.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A large party of 30 people is going to attend a school reunion. The function room will be furnished with a number of tables, each of which seats four people. To calculate how many tables of four are required, and how many people will be\n",
    "left over, the division and modulus operators could be used as follows:\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "int tablesOfFour, peopleLeftOver;\n",
    "tablesOfFour = 30/4; // number of tables\n",
    "peopleLeftOver = 30%4; // number of people left over\n",
    "```\n",

    "blesOfFour (30/4) did not yield 7.5 but 7. The reason for this is that there are, in fact, two different in-built division routines in Java, one to calculate an integer answer and another to calculate the answer as a real number.\n",
    "Rather than having two division operators, however, Java has a single division symbol (/) to represent both types of division. The division operator is said to be overloaded. This means that the same operator (in this case the division symbol) can behave in different ways. This makes life much easier for programmers as the\n",
    "decision about which routine to call is left to the Java language.\n",

It does this by implicitly converting each value/expression to a string before displaying it on the screen.

    "### 2.9 Program Design\n",
    "Designing a program is the task of considering exactly how to build the software, whereas writing the code (the task of actually building the software) is referred to as implementation. As programs get more complex, it is important to spend time on program design, before launching into program implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already said, Java programs consist of one or more classes, each with one or more methods. In later chapters we will introduce you to the use of diagrams to help design such classes. The programs we have considered so far,\n",
    "however, have only a single class and a single method (main), so a class diagram would not be very useful here. We will therefore return to this design technique as we develop larger programs involving many classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a lower level, it is the instructions within a method that determine the be- haviour of that method. If the behaviour of a method is complex, then it will also be worthwhile spending time on designing the instructions that make up the method.\n",
    "When you sketch out the code for your methods, you don’t want to have to worry about the finer details of the Java compiler such as declaring variables, adding semi-colons and using the right brackets. Very often a general purpose “coding\n",
    "language” can be used for this purpose to convey the meaning of each instruction without worrying too much about a specific language syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code expressed in this way is often referred to as pseudocode. The following isan example of pseudocode that could have been developed for the main method of FindCost3 program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "DISPLAY program title\n",
    "DISPLAY prompt for price\n",
    "ENTER price\n",
    "DISPLAY prompt for tax\n",
    "ENTER tax\n",
    "SET price TO price * (1 + tax/100)\n",
    "DISPLAY new price\n",
    "END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these pseudocode instructions are not intended to be typed in and compiled as they do not meet the syntax rules of any particular programming language. So, exactly how you write these instructions is up to you: there is no fixed\n",
    "syntax for them. However, each instruction conveys a well-understood programming concept and can easily be translated into a given programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read these instructions you should be able to see how each line would be coded in Java. Wouldn’t it be much easier to write your main method if you have pseudocode like this to follow? In future, when we present complex methods to you we will do so by presenting their logic using pseudocode."
